#  Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Lab Activity)

This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** web game created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed as a **lab activity for students** to help them understand the basics of:

- HTML structure
- CSS styling and responsive design
- JavaScript events and logic
- DOM manipulation
- UI interaction

---

##  Purpose of This Lab

The goal of this lab is to provide students with hands-on experience with core web development concepts. After completing this activity, students will be able to:

- Understand how buttons trigger events in JavaScript
- Track user input and program logic flow
- Dynamically update content using `innerText` and DOM APIs
- Style UI elements creatively and responsively for different devices

---

##  Files Included

- `index.html` â€“ Main HTML file that defines the structure of the game
- `style.css` â€“ CSS file for layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design
- `script.js` â€“ JavaScript file that handles game logic and interactivity
- `README.md` â€“ This file, containing instructions and learning goals

- Add game history or round tracker
- Convert it into a multiplayer version

---

## Instructor Notes

This project is ideal for a **1-hour lab session** where students:
- Start from a basic HTML/CSS template
- Walk through JavaScript event logic
- Add game features incrementally

Encourage students to experiment and reflect on how the code structure connects UI and logic.
